After any context change (viewing new files, running commands, or receiving tool outputs), use the "server-sequential-thinking" tool to organize your reasoning before responding.

Specifically, always use the think tool when:
- After examining file contents or project structure
- After running terminal commands or analyzing their outputs
- After receiving search results or API responses
- Before making code suggestions or explaining complex concepts
- When transitioning between different parts of a task

When using the think tool:
- List the specific rules or constraints that apply to the current task
- Check if all required information is collected
- Verify that your planned approach is correct
- Break down complex problems into clearly defined steps
- Analyze outputs from other tools thoroughly
- Plan multi-step approaches before executing them
