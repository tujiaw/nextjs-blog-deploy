CentOS6不再维护了，目前机器需要更换yum源，地址：https://vault.centos.org/  

CentOS 6 is now End of Life and there are no more updates

Red Hat have pulled the plug on RHEL 6.x as of Nov 30th 2020 and as a result CentOS 6 is now a dead version. The online yum repos for CentOS 6 have been archived to vault.centos.org and there will be no more updates to it at all, ever.

We will leave the CentOS 6 forums open until the end of the year for new posts and then they will be moved under the legacy forums at the bottom of the main page and marked as readonly.

If you still run CentOS 6 then you should be aware that it will steadily get less and less safe to run. You have a few options:

* 1) reinstall with a newer version
* 2) Convert your CentOS 6 system to RHEL 6 and then sign up for a RHEL 6 ELS subscription (costs $$) which will give you another 2 or 3 years of security updates before it too goes EOL.
* 3) pick a different distro
* 4) get hacked at some point in the future...

Doing nothing is not an option unless you want to end up in option 4) above and be on the front pages of the various tech websites/publications as being the next Equifax...

It's not possible for CentOS to continue to support CentOS 6 as Red Hat no longer publish the source code for fixes made after the EOL date.
